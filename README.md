# admin-module-qt-python
standalone project in Qt Python for Admin Module Implementation for learning purpose

### Project Description:

This repository hosts the implementation of an Admin Module using PySide6, the Qt for Python module. The module focuses on user administration functionalities within a system, providing a seamless interface for user management.

#### Key Functionalities:

1. **User Creation:** Enables the addition of new users to the system, facilitating the expansion of user base with ease and efficiency.

2. **User Editing:** Allows for the modification of existing user details, ensuring accurate and up-to-date user information within the system.

3. **User Removal:** Provides the capability to remove users from the system when necessary, maintaining data integrity and security protocols.

4. **Password Management:** Implements secure password handling through bcrypt encryption, ensuring robust authentication processes for user accounts.

5. **Role-Based Access Control:** Introduces distinct user roles such as admin, developer, employee, and manager, each tailored to specific organizational responsibilities.

6. **Role-Specific Functionality:** Assigns role-based access permissions, granting users access to both generic and role-specific functionalities as per their designated roles.

7. **Authorization Mechanism:** Utilizes role permission mapping to regulate access to different sections of the application based on user roles, ensuring appropriate page access permissions.

#### Dependencies:

- PySide6: The Qt for Python module provides the foundation for GUI development.
- bcrypt: Utilized for secure password hashing and authentication.
